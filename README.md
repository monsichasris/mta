# Moving Tiles Art - NYC Subway
This project, part of Data as Material assignment at Parsons School of Design, transforms real-time MTA (Metropolitan Transportation Authority) train arrival data into dynamic pixel tile patterns inspired by subway mosaic art. Each station generates a unique pattern based on the trains arriving at that moment—select a station to see its evolving design.
